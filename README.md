# A bit about myself...
Hi there!
I am from Papua New Guinea. "Where is that?" you ask. It is located above Australia. 
I aspire to be a software engineer. I fell in love with the idea of making video games, which led me to persue a degree in computer science.

Nerd Alert! Yeah I am, 21 years of age. I have no practical experience, but I love solving problems. Hence, that is why I am here.
